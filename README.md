# THIS IS A FORK

If you are looking for the original SplineMesh, this ain't it.


## Why the fork
Changes made here are all aiming to make SplineMesh more fit for real-time object trails. Esentially, this is just part of [SMTrails](https://github.com/PepeOjeda/SMTrails).
Some of those changes involve performance improvements, some involve different options for UV manipulation, some will be crazy and inescrutable.

Overall, this is a less usable version of SplineMesh if you are planning to do anything except the very specific application that the changes are made for.
